 Question :

We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. 

As I have not much practical sxposer in this java or other coding language ..but What I understand based my computer science studies and some google help..

Nested object is something other objects can be fetched from another object.  To acces these objects we need to use (.) dot or bracket [] notation 

Example :


==============

var ourhome =     {

"Bedroom" : {
   "Bed" : "Bedsheet"

},

   " Studyroom" :  {
  
    "Computer"  :  {
   
         "keyboard": "alphabet"
         "Screen"  : "Movies"
},

"Kitchen" : "Food"

}
}



So if I need to see movie as output then the call will be

ourhome.Studyroom[ "Computer" ].screen:,     >>> output is movie
